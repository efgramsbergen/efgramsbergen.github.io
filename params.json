{"name":"Efgramsbergen.GitHub.io","tagline":"","body":"## Egbert's experimental homepage\r\n*Hello, I am Egbert Gramsbergen. I studied physics and now I am a data engineer. What is a data engineer? Nobody knows, including me.*\r\n\r\n**My github handle:** efgramsbergen\r\n\r\n**What to do in my hometown Delft:** climb the main church tower, then reward yourself with a beer in one of the many cafes. And don't buy Delft Blue pottery, it's only for tourists and it's a ripoff.\r\n\r\n**Favorite book at the moment:** Getallen zijn je beste vrienden (numbers are your best friends).\r\n\r\n**Favorite cities:** Rome, New York (but this list may change depending on my mood. Today I think Copenhagen is quite nice but things may change when it is raining tomorrow)\r\n\r\n**Favorite formulas:** Maxwell's equations. I will wear them on a T-shirt tomorrow for everyone to admire.\r\n\r\n![Maxwell's equations](http://www.maxwells-equations.com/maxwells-equations.gif)\r\n\r\n**Favorite cartoon character:** Spongebob. Really? Yes, really.\r\n\r\n![Spongebob](https://camo.githubusercontent.com/c13375a795b6c3c12ad75b1ea6a17477153e8dac/687474703a2f2f696d616765732e68756666696e67746f6e706f73742e636f6d2f323031352d30372d31342d313433363930323536352d363233353031382d53706f6e6765426f625f352e706e67)\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!

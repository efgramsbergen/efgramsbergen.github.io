## Egbert's experimental homepage
*Hello, I am Egbert Gramsbergen. I studied physics and now I am a data engineer. What is a data engineer? Nobody knows, including me.*
**My github handle:** efgramsbergen
**What to do in my hometown Delft:** climb the main church tower, then reward yourself with a beer in one of the many cafes. And don't buy Delft Blue pottery, it's only for tourists and it's a ripoff.
**Favorite book at the moment:** Getallen zijn je beste vrienden (numbers are your best friends).
**Favorite cities:** Rome, New York (but this list may change depending on my mood. Today I think Copenhagen is quite nice but things may change when it is raining tomorrow)
**Favorite formulas:** Maxwell's equation. I will wear them on a T-shirt tomorrow for everyone to admire.

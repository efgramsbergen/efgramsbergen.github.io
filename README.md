## Egbert's experimental homepage
Hello, I am Egbert Gramsbergen. I studied physics and now I am a data engineer. What is a data engineer? Nobody knows, including me.
*My github handle:* efgramsbergen
*What to do in my hometown Delft:* clomb the main church tower, then reward yourself with a beer in one of the many cafes. And don't buy Delft Blue pottery, it's only for tourists and it's a ripoff.
*Favorite book at the moment:* Getallen zijn je beste vrienden (numbers are your best friends).
